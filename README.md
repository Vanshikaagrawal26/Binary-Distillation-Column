# ðŸ§ª Binary Distillation Column Design

An interactive Streamlit app to visualize the **McCabe-Thiele method** for binary distillation.  
This tool helps you understand how **operating lines**, and **feed conditions** determine the design of a distillation column.

## ðŸ“Œ Features

- Interactive sliders for:
  - Feed composition (`xF`)
  - Distillate composition (`xD`)
  - Bottom composition (`xB`)
  - Reflux ratio (`R`)
  - Relative volatility (`Î±`)
- Assumes **q = 1** (saturated liquid feed)
- Plots:
  - Equilibrium curve
  - Rectifying section line
  - Stripping section line
  - Feed line (vertical, since `q = 1`)

## ðŸ§® Operating Line Equations

**Rectifying Section:**

y = (R / (R + 1)) * x + xD / (R + 1)


**Stripping Section:**

y = ((y_int âˆ’ xB) / (xF âˆ’ xB)) * (x âˆ’ xB) + xB


**Flow-based Stripping Line:**

y = (Lâ€² / Vâ€²) * x âˆ’ (B / Vâ€²) * xB
